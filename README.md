# Monty-Hall-problem

The Monty Hall Problem is a well-known puzzle derived from an American game show, “Let’s Make a Deal”. The Monty Hall Problem is like this:

" Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? "

The role of the host as follows:

1) The host must always open a door that was not picked by the contestant.
2) The host must always open a door to reveal a goat and never the car.
3) The host must always offer the chance to switch between the originally chosen door and the remaining closed door.

The competitor chooses to change the gate or chooses to stick to the first choice.
